**Geospatial Hazard Intelligence for VFR Aviation in Germany**

![Dashboard Preview](screenshot/screen01.png)

## Executive Summary

**Aerovert-DE** is a geospatial intelligence platform designed to analyze and visualize **vertical obstacle risk** in German airspace using archived NOTAM data from 2025.

The platform focuses on obstacles that directly impact **VFR aviation safety**, including wind turbines, construction cranes, masts, and obstruction lighting. By transforming unstructured aviation notices into structured geospatial intelligence, Aerovert-DE enables both **operational awareness** and **strategic analysis** of airspace saturation.

This project is intentionally built as a **production-grade demonstration system**, reflecting how such a platform would be engineered in a professional aviation, infrastructure, or geospatial analytics environment.

## The Problem

Germany’s rapid expansion of renewable energy infrastructure has introduced thousands of new vertical structures into low-altitude airspace.

Key challenges include:

* Wind turbines exceeding 200 meters in height
* Temporary construction cranes appearing with high frequency
* NOTAM data published primarily as unstructured free text
* Limited tools for visualizing obstacle density and vertical congestion
* Increased night-flight risk from unlit obstacles (NVFR hazards)

The central question this project addresses is:

**Where and how is vertical obstacle saturation creating elevated risk for VFR operations in German airspace?**

---

## What the Platform Delivers

Aerovert-DE provides three tightly integrated capabilities:

1. **Operational Hazard Mapping**
2. **Vertical Risk & Saturation Analytics**
3. **Strategic Airspace Intelligence**

These are not mockups — the screenshots represent a fully functioning system.

## Operational Hazard Map

The core interface is an interactive map of Germany displaying thousands of classified obstacles derived from archived NOTAMs.

### Map Capabilities

* High-density geospatial rendering with clustering
* Aviation-optimized dark basemap for low-contrast environments
* Real-time filtering by:
  * Obstacle type (wind, crane, mast, lights)
  * FIR (EDWW, EDGG, EDMM)
  * Vertical limits (Flight Level ranges)
  * NVFR-only hazards (unlit obstacles)

Each map marker opens a **structured hazard card**, showing:

* FIR and NOTAM reference ID
* Obstacle classification
* Maximum vertical extent expressed in **Flight Levels (FL)**
* Horizontal influence radius (NM)
* Active date range
* Original NOTAM text for traceability

This preserves a verifiable link between raw aviation data and derived intelligence.

---

## Vertical Risk & Saturation Analysis

Beyond simple visualization, Aerovert-DE models **vertical airspace congestion**, a critical factor for VFR safety.

The platform enables:

* Identification of **VFR conflict bands** (e.g., 500–2000 ft)
* Visualization of vertical obstacle concentration (“the wall” effect)
* Differentiation between compliant obstacles and NVFR hazards
* Analysis of height distributions by obstacle type

This vertical perspective transforms flat obstacle data into **risk-aware intelligence**.

---

## Strategic Intelligence Dashboard

The analytics dashboard provides decision-oriented metrics rather than cosmetic charts.

Key outputs include:

* Total active obstacles
* NVFR hazard count (unlit structures)
* Regional risk comparison by FIR
* Monthly construction and hazard activity trends
* Obstacle composition breakdown
* Ranked list of critical hazards combining:
  * Height
  * Region
  * Obstacle type
  * Original NOTAM context

This supports both **operational scanning** and **strategic airspace analysis**.

---

## Insights Enabled by the Platform

Using the processed 2025 dataset, Aerovert-DE makes the following analyses possible:

* Northern Germany (EDWW) exhibits significantly higher obstacle density than southern regions
* Wind farm construction contributes to persistent vertical congestion in VFR-relevant flight levels
* Unlit obstacles represent a disproportionate night-flight risk
* Construction activity follows clear seasonal patterns
* Some obstacles remain active longer than initially published, creating extended exposure windows

These insights are driven by **data engineering and domain logic**, not by visualization alone.

## Architecture Overview

Aerovert-DE follows a clean, production-oriented monorepo architecture:

```
┌────────────────────┐
│  Next.js Web App   │  → Operational map & analytics UI
└─────────┬──────────┘
          │ REST API
┌─────────▼──────────┐
│   FastAPI Backend  │  → Parsing, analytics, geospatial queries
└─────────┬──────────┘
          │ SQL / GIS
┌─────────▼──────────┐
│ PostgreSQL + GIS   │  → Persistent spatial intelligence
└────────────────────┘
```

This separation ensures:

* UI remains fast and stateless
* Domain logic is centralized server-side
* Geospatial correctness is enforced at the database level
